## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### 1. Get a Recommendation WebSocket URL

#### Production

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-foodhak.com/barcode-recommend \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "USER123", "barcode": "3029330003533"}'
````


**Response:**

```json
{
  "websocket_url": "wss://ai-foodhak.com/ws/recommend/USER123",
  "message": "Please use this WebSocket URL to connect for real-time recommendations."
}
```

### 2. Connect to WebSocket for Real-time Recommendation

**WebSocket Endpoint:**

* Production: `wss://ai-foodhak.com/ws/recommend/{user_id}`
* Staging: `wss://staging.ai-foodhak.com/ws/recommend/{user_id}`

**Send (as JSON):**

```json
{
  "barcode": "3029330003533"
}
```

**Receive (streamed JSON):**

* `type: streaming` (the AI-generated response in chunks)
* `type: message_stop` (completion signal)
* `type: error` (for any errors)

#### Example: Python WebSocket Client

```python
import websockets
import asyncio
import json

async def get_recommendation(user_id, barcode):
    uri = f"wss://ai-foodhak.com/ws/recommend/{user_id}"
    async with websockets.connect(uri) as ws:
        await ws.send(json.dumps({"barcode": barcode}))
        async for message in ws:
            print(message)

asyncio.run(get_recommendation("USER123", "3029330003533"))
```
